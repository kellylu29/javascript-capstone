# JavaScript Capstone Project

#### A single page app allowing the user to play a simple game of Wheel of Fortune. Use JavaScript to give the user a word to guess letter by letter. Will the user lose points as they guess wrong? Will they try to beat the clock? Do they only get 3 guesses? You decide! Make it clear to the user what their goal is. The app should be styled with simple but modern design trends and fun for the user. Remember keep your user engaged.
